CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


Architecture:
In the full-stack project, I implemented Express routes, rendering HTML with client-side JavaScript, and built an Angular SPA. Express pages reload on each HTTP request, while the SPA uses client-side routing, modules, components, reactive forms, and a component tree for dynamic updates. MongoDB was chosen for its flexible JSON-like documents and horizontal scalability.

Functionality:
JSON is a lightweight text format for serializing structured data, distinct from executable JavaScript code. It bridges the front end and back end by encapsulating request payloads and API responses. I refactored the UI into reusable Angular components—forms, cards, and navigation modules—to reduce duplication, simplify maintenance, and accelerate feature development.

Testing:
Using Postmate, I tested GET and PUT endpoints to validate data retrieval and updates, while integration tests against the Express API verify CORS policies and authentication middleware. This layered approach ensures each endpoint behaves correctly and maintains data integrity across the client and server.

Reflection:
This course bolstered my professional growth by deepening my mastery of the MEAN stack, TypeScript, and RESTful API design. I developed skills in modular component design, asynchronous data handling, automated testing, and collaborative workflows. These competencies make me a more marketable full-stack developer ready to deliver secure applications.
